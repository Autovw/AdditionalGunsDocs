How cool would it be to add your own guns into Minecraft?
Well, thanks to [MrCrayfish's Gun Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mrcrayfishs-gun-mod) that is possible!

This guide explains how to contribute to Additional Guns, the community add-on for MrCrayfish's Gun Mod.

***

**Requirements:**

_All of the information here will be explained more in-depth on other pages!._

* [Blockbench](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mrcrayfishs-gun-mod)
  * _Blockbench is a program used to make models for Minecraft. The program is used by MrCrayfish and even by Mojang themselves! It has a web version and a download version._
* [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
  * _In order to contribute your assets to the community add-on you'll need to register a GitHub account. (Skip this step if you already have one)_

If you are planning to contribute multiple assets to the mod please consider installing these too:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  * _Git is a version control system that makes contributing to open-source projects a million times easier._
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
  * _Even though GitHub Desktop isn't required if you are experienced with Git, it does add a very easy to use GUI which makes using Git easier for people that prefer a simple GUI over the command line. Keep in mind that GitHub Desktop requires Git to be installed!_

Planning on doing programming? Install these too!

* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?fromIDE=#section=windows) or [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

* JDK (Java Development Kit)
  * [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot)
